The purpose of TrendLinks is to show the most popular links in Twitter to
keep everybody informed about what is happening in the world

To be precise, urls provided from different shorteners will be solved and counted as the same.

Next features:
- Show popular links organized by countries
- Have a list of categories, as videos, pics and others


The app has the following jobs:
>>> search.rb 
"Search links in Twitter API, separate the links and populate the database with the shortened links"

>>> resolverProcessor.rb
"Solve the shortened urls"

>>> executor.rb
"Solve the shortened urls and populate the database creating threads of resolverProcessor"

>>> clean_history.rb
"Delete urls older than 6hs from database"

>>> clean_copy.rb
"Delete all from current/shorteners and copy new resolveds to current/shorteners"

All jobs are initialized automatically when the server boots except the executor. Run to start:
  ruby /var/www/rr10-team-233/script/executor.rb &
